The `KafkaMultiConsumer` `@KafkaListener` has 3 methods; one for each of the known objects and a fallback default method for others.

Run the application and use curl to send some data:

`$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/send/foo/bar`

`$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/send/bar/baz`

`$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/send/unknown/xxx`

Console:

`Received: Foo [foo=bar]`
`Received: Bar [bar=baz]`
`Received unknown: xxx`
